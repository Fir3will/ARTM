# ARTM
###### (Another Redundant Technology Mod)
The ARTM mod introduces "new" and "exciting" technologies into the
Minecraft world! The basis of this mod is learning. Nobody is able to
from scratch be able to create a huge mechanical empire. This mod
introduces learning technologies and structures before being able to
construct technological marvels.

##### Wiki
There is a Wiki included on this Git so feel free to browse that for
much more information on the mod as well. While there is an in-game
guide, it might be better to browse the Wiki here.

##### Issues
If during use, an issue is found, feel free to file an issue here on
Github. I am also open to changes from the community so feel free to
register a pull/merge request. This also includes the `.lang` files.

Thanks to all that made this mod what it is!
